# CPNT201-Image-processing
### 1. Resize the images into 350 x 300;
### 2. Optimize using PS. Put them into files for large/lg and small/sm. Normal images are directly in the folder;
### 3. Broken image here [Broken image](http://www.google.com/)
My problem: For broken image, even I break the src in html, the broken image would not be an empty in the page layout that is width x height.
